<h3>Initial Health and Damage:</h3>
<p>Each snake has its health initially set to 10 hp.</p>

<h3>Attack Model:</h3>
<p>Every time a snake is hit by head of another snake, its health will be reduced by 10 (length reduced by 1 respectively).</p>

<h3>Food-health Model:</h3>
<p>The total number of food in the board should be (number of users - 1) so as to force competition. Once a food is taken another one will be generated randomly into the board.
Once a snake takes in a food the length will be increased by 1 (health increased by 10 until it reaches the maximum health) to win.</p>
